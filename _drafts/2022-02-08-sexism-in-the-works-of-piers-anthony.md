## Introduction

Admittedly, this is based on only reading a few books in the *[Incarnations of Immortality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarnations_of_Immortality)* series. But I thought I'd share my thoughts anyway.

## Initial Thoughts After Finishing the First Book

Yeah, I can see why there's been a bit of a reckoning with regard to Anthony's writing. It's certainly sexist. Even if the setup (killing Death to take his place) and crux (a battle against Satan, whereby Zane/Death wins by "believing in himself" - not a real quote, but certainly not inaccurate) are pretty interesting, it's not enough to cover up the blatant sexism.

The main female character (Luna, the love interest of Zane/Death) is introduced as a pawn of her father, with the only focus being on her looks/beauty. (I'm pretty sure she's actually naked in the scene.) Even when she does perhaps develop some agency, she maintains her "daddy knows best" attitude, and Anthony continues to focus far more than is necessary on how she looks. The female characters are also only partially closed - or even completely naked - far more often than is necessary.

Even the (female, obviously) ghost is sexualized. She died at 16, and even though she's apparently been dead for thousands of years, lusting after her is still very much not okay. Zane is still lusting after the body of a 16 year old and commenting on her tits. Just... No thanks.

Unfortunately (perhaps sadly), I find myself reading around this sexism pretty easily. I also tend to skim this style of books and not pay terribly close attention. But once I thought about it for a minute, it was pretty bad.

So... Will I read the rest of the series? Probably. I'm still trying to get back into reading, and these books read quite easily. Will I advertise that I'm reading them? Certainly not, unless that advertisement is couched heavily in an explanation that I'm revisiting them to see what all the "Piers Anthony is sexist" fuss is about. And yes, the fuss is warranted.

## Follow-Up Thoughts

There's also a weird focus on Luna's virginity. Zane seems to want her to be a virgin, and he's upset when the Devil implies that she's not. She's also supposedly raped by a demo from Hell, which is then walked back to "only" a psychic/mental rape. And that's somehow acceptable because her body is still pure? That's fucked up.

Actually, I think it was consensual, since she was trying to learn about black magic to save her father or whatever, but it's still weird af. Anyway, I guess the problem is that I read (this type of story/genre anyway) to turn my brain off - not to think too much. Probably not ideal with so problematic a book.

## Post-Research Thoughts

Most of the articles that I found confirmed my notes about sexism, others provided added details around themes of pedophilia, and a few disagreed but seemed to have an apologist bent.

First, I read Jason Heller's "[Revisiting the sad, misogynistic fantasy of Xanth](https://www.avclub.com/revisiting-the-sad-misogynistic-fantasy-of-xanth-1798241312)" on *AV Club*. It was focused on his reread of [[Anthony, Piers (1977) Spell for Chameleon, A]], which was the first novel of Anthony's Xanth series. In his words, the expectations was:

> Thanks, Piers Anthony, for the swell book, not mention giving me a tidy epiphany about how fantasy, geography, and nostalgia overlap in the hazy mists of reminiscence.

But reality wasn't as pretty:

> Instead, this happened: I reread A Spell For Chameleon, and during those excruciating hours all I could think about was what a sad, misogynistic piece of shit it is.

He goes on to explain the misogyny of the books, which largely lined up with my notes about *On a Pale Horse*. The only thing I'd note is that *A Spell for Chameleon* sounded worse that *On a Pale Horse*.

Next, I read Joshua Chaplisky's "[Themes of Pedophilia in the Works of Piers Anthony](https://litreactor.com/columns/themes-of-pedophilia-in-the-works-of-piers-anthony)" on *Lit Reactor.*

Finally, to ensure that I wasn't getting a one-sided representation, I read Piers Anthony's own words in a Q&A entitled "[Piers Anthony Unbound](https://news.slashdot.org/story/02/07/14/1854209/piers-anthony-unbound)" on *Slashdot*. His answer to question nine deals specifically with pedophilia, where he basically says it's fine and admits that he corresponds with a convicted pedophile who's in prison.

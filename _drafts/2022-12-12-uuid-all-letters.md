UUID strings have 32 characters, each of which can be a number (``0-9``) or a lowercase letter (``a-z``). That means there are 36 possible choices for each position, and 26 of those choices are letters. Since the probability of getting a letter in each spot is independent (assuming we're generating these UUID strings purely randomly), the probability $p$ is given by:

$$
p = \left( \frac{26}{36} \right)^{32} \approx 0.003 \%
$$

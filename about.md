This is my blog.

Unrelated to the rest of this blog, this page was necessary to register my A2P Campaign so that I could use Twilio to send myself text messages.

## Terms and Conditions

These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern my participation in the personal Application-to-Person ("A2P") messaging campaign ("Service"). I am using this Service solely for personal, non-commercial use, and the Service is not offered for marketing, promotional, or business purposes. As the sole user of this Service, I have agreed to these Terms.

The Service is only sending text messages (SMS/MMS) to myself, and I have opted in. This Service is not used for advertising, telemarketing, or promotional campaigns. I may send myself multiple messages per month, and message and data rates may apply. Further, I may opt out of this service at any time by repling "STOP". After I send "STOP", I will receive one confirmation message, and no further messages will be sent unless you opt in again. For help, I may reply "HELP" or contact myself.

The Service is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. I may update these Terms at any time. Continued participation in the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

If you have questions regarding these Terms, please contact me.

## Privacy Policy

This site does not collect any user data. The A2P Service does not collect any user data, except that I have provided myself my own phone number.
